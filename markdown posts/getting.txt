# Getting Started with Ethical Hacking

🔍 *A Beginner’s Guide to Cybersecurity and Ethical Hacking*

## Introduction
In today's digital world, cyber threats are everywhere, from identity theft to corporate hacking incidents. Ethical hacking plays a **critical role** in cybersecurity by helping organizations **identify vulnerabilities** before malicious hackers can exploit them.

But how do you start learning ethical hacking? Do you need a computer science degree? What tools do professionals use? In this guide, I’ll walk you through everything you need to **become an ethical hacker, step by step.**

## What is Ethical Hacking?
Ethical hacking, also known as **penetration testing**, is the **legal and authorized** process of testing computer systems, networks, and applications to uncover security weaknesses. Unlike malicious hackers, ethical hackers follow rules and get permission to test systems.

### 🔹 Why is ethical hacking important?
- Protects sensitive data from cybercriminals.
- Helps organizations strengthen security measures.
- Ensures compliance with cybersecurity laws and regulations.

💡 **Example**:
A company hires an ethical hacker to test their **banking app** for vulnerabilities. The hacker finds a security loophole that could allow an attacker to steal money. The company **fixes the issue** before real hackers exploit it.

## Types of Hackers 🏴‍☠️ vs. ⚔️

There are different types of hackers, but **not all are bad**. Here's a breakdown:

### 1️⃣ Black Hat Hackers (Criminals) 🚨
- Hack into systems **illegally** for personal gain.
- Steal data, disrupt services, or spread malware.
- Example: Hackers who steal credit card information from online stores.

### 2️⃣ White Hat Hackers (Ethical Hackers) ✅
- Work **legally** to protect companies from attacks.
- Get paid to **find security weaknesses** before bad hackers do.
- Example: A security researcher finds a bug in a government website and reports it.

### 3️⃣ Gray Hat Hackers (Mixed Ethics) ⚖️
- Hack systems without permission **but don’t cause harm**.
- They sometimes report security issues but still **break rules**.
- Example: A hacker breaks into a social media platform to expose privacy flaws but doesn’t steal data.

## Common Cybersecurity Attacks & How to Prevent Them 🚨

| Attack Type | How It Works | How to Prevent |
|------------|------------|----------------|
| **Phishing** 🎣 | Hackers send fake emails to trick people into revealing passwords. | Don't click suspicious links, always verify email senders. |
| **SQL Injection** 🛠️ | Injecting malicious SQL code to steal or delete database data. | Use prepared statements and parameterized queries. |
| **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** 🌍 | Injecting malicious JavaScript into a website to steal user data. | Sanitize input, use Content Security Policy (CSP). |
| **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)** 🔍 | Intercepting communication between two parties. | Use **HTTPS**, VPNs, and strong encryption. |
